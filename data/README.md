## Dataset Dictionary
### UID
A Unique Identifier (UID) is employed to distinguish individual policies and establish a mapping between the metadata database and specific policies. The UID consists of two segments: the first part indicates the year of archiving, and the second part denotes a sequential number. For example, the UID "201317437" means that the policy was archived in 2013 and is the 17,437th entry in the overall sequence.

### URL
A URL is the web address that points to the exact online location of a policy document. It is used to direct users to the specific web page where they can access the full text of the policy document.

### Year
This refers to the calendar year when a policy is officially enacted or promulgated by the governing body.

### Policy Title
This denotes the formal name given to a policy document that briefly describes its main focus or subject matter. The title serves as an identifier and offers insights into the scope and intent of the policy without having to read the entire document.

### Policy Title in Chinese
Given that the target audience is English - speaking while the subject matter is in Chinese, this term refers to the exact translation of the policy's title from Chinese to English.

### Category - I
From a policy science perspective, policies can be categorized based on the regulatory approach they adopt. Here, we propose three categories: Command - and - Control Instrument (CCI), Market - based and mixed Instrument (MXI), and Voluntary Instrument (VOI).

### Category - II
This classification is based on a lexicon system designed to match the most potentially relevant sub - dimensions with policy content. It serves as an introductory guide for further quantitative analysis in a specific field. For instance, the Implementation Plan of China Green Lighting Project policy could be categorized as Mitigation_Buildings_Efficient Lighting, Appliances And Equipment with the unique code 132.
